Created a sample project to demonstrate webhook project using simple alert system. 

A alert simulator api will simulate an alert message which later will be processed by webhook api to send the request to the exposed api of alert receiver. 
Here created an dummy alert receiver api which will act as client application which will receive the webhook request.
